# mcbuilder
Command line modpack builder for Minecraft!

## CurseForge mod
A userscript that replaces unnnessecarily long and indirect "Install" links on the curseforge page with direct `curseforge://` links, might take a bit for the replacement to happen after the page loads. Useful when used in conjunction with the URL handler (`mcbuilder register`), but should work with the Curse client as well. Fixes the URL handler not triggering if another mod is being installed at the moment.
